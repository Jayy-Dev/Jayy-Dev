**`(Developer/Kontributor/Photographer)`**

I'm a Front-End Developer and Photograper creating my own way of showing the wolrd how beautiful they're computer can become. All coding projects are built from scratch and designing all  the way to solving real-life problems with code. Photography is built different, from ideation and shooting, all the way to finalizing and making it look beautiful on different people.
